##### Instructions

The below were the instructions that were given by By HyperionDev a guide in creating this website.

**Note: Feel free to reuse any work you have already done for this project. Your online store is required to implement the following:**

- Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following JavaScript functionality:
  - Create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
  - Allow a “quick add to cart” from the catalogue page.
  - Each product’s page must also have the option to “add to cart”.
  - When an item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
  - Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in their cart, each item’s price, and the total cost (remember to add VAT!)
  - Create a form which allows for “discount coupons”.
  - Create forms to allow a user to select “collection” or “delivery”.
  - Create forms for different delivery options.
  - Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and if a certain coupon is applied.
  - Create a “confirm order” button which alerts the user that their order was successful and generates them a reference number (keyword: generate)
  - Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
    - A function which contains hiding/showing.
    - A drop-down menu.
    - Animation effects.
    - A function with chained effects.
